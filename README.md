# Mobile Pack for jQuery Mobile

***[jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/)*** is a touch-optimized web framework that lets you develop mobile web applications using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 for a wide variety of smartphones and tablet computers. This Mobile Pack presents 3 samples of a [single page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) JavaScript contact management app that demonstrates how to use jQuery Mobile with the Force.com REST API from either a Visualforce page or an external mobile web app implemented in PHP or Node.js.

## Getting Started

The Mobile Pack for jQuery Mobile supports two deployment options for your HTML5 mobile app. To use the Mobile Pack with a Visualforce page (i.e. host the app on Force.com), follow [this quick start](http://events.developerforce.com/mobile/getting-started/html5#jquery). To deploy your HTML5 app externally (e.g. on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)) and source data from Salesforce, follow [this quick start](http://events.developerforce.com/mobile/getting-started/html5#jquery-heroku).
 
## Whatâ€™s included in this Mobile Pack

* `Samples/jQueryMobileVF` - a Visualforce page and supporting static resources that implements the single page contact management app.
* `Samples/jQueryMobileHerokuPHP` - a sample mobile web app that can be deployed outside of Force.com (and for this example deploys to Heroku). It serves up the same single page contact management app that uses the ForceTK library as a JavaScript wrapper for the Force.com REST API to grab your data and communicates back to the Salesforce Platform via a PHP proxy.
* `Samples/jQueryMobileHerokuNode` - a sample mobile web app that can be deployed outside of Force.com (and for this example deploys to Heroku). It serves up the same single page contact management app that uses the ForceTK library as a JavaScript wrapper for the Force.com REST API to grab your data and communicates back to the Salesforce Platform via a Node.js proxy.
